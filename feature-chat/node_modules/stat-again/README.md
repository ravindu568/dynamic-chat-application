# stat-again
Helper for running tests interacting with the file system: It should happen, but when? So stat again!

## Simple usage

When a file or a directory should be there but is not, or shouldn't be there but still is, promises are to be made and resolved. Node module ```stat-again``` factors out some of the cumbersome logic.

### Expecting a file or directory to be created

```js
import {expectEventuallyFound} from 'stat-again';

const pathname = 'dir/file.js';
const delayInMs = 30;
const numberOfTries = 10;

expectEventuallyFound(pathname, delayInMs, numberOfTries)
  .then(() => {
    // File was found within a reasonable time
  }, err => {
    // Handle error
  });
```

### Expecting a file or directory to be deleted

```js
import {expectEventuallyDeleted} from 'stat-again';

const pathname = 'dir/file.js';
const delayInMs = 30;
const numberOfTries = 10;

expectEventuallyDeleted(pathname, delayInMs, numberOfTries)
  .then(() => {
    // File was deleted within a reasonable time
  }, err => {
    // Handle error
  });
```

### Stating eventually a file or directory

Stats are as returned by [fs.stat(path, callback)](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_stat_path_callback).

```js
import statAgain from 'stat-again';

const pathname = 'dir/file.js';
const delayInMs = 30;
const numberOfTries = 10;

statAgain(pathname, delayInMs, numberOfTries)
  .then(stats => {
    // Do something with stats
  }, err => {
    // Handle error
  });
```

### Comparing two file last modifications

```js
import {isNewerThan} from 'stat-again';

const pathname1 = 'dir/file1.js';
const pathname2 = 'dir/file2.js';

isNewerThan(pathname1, pathname2)
  .then(bool => {
    if (bool) {
      // file1 is newer than file2...
    } else {
      // ...
    }
  }, err => {
    // Handle error
  });
```
